# EnKosi
This application helps you take screenshots of websites and their current state. It is an engine that can be run in the background.

Best suited for functional testing. as you parse commands using JS to PhantomJS and can be modified.

Kindly note that its in its alpha state and you(besides me) will help publicly push for a stable v3 :)
